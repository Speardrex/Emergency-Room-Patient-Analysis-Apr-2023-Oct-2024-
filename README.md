# Emergency-Room-Patient-Analysis-Apr-2023-Oct-2024-
## Project Overview
This project analyzes 9,216 emergency room patients over 19 months using Power BI. The goal was to uncover patterns in patient flow, satisfaction, demographics, and admissions to help optimize healthcare resource allocation.

Tools Used: Power BI, Excel/SQL (data preprocessing), DAX (calculated measures)

Skills Demonstrated: Data cleaning, data visualization, descriptive analysis, storytelling with data

**Key Findings**
⏳ Patient Wait Time & Satisfaction
- Avg wait time: 35.3 minutes → signals delays in patient flow.
- Satisfaction score: 4.99/10 → shows moderate satisfaction; clear room for improvement.

🏥 Departmental Referrals

- 5,400 patients required no referrals.

Most referred departments:

- General Practice (1,840 cases)
- Orthopedics (995 cases)
- Physiotherapy (276 cases), Cardiology (248 cases).

📅 Peak Busy Periods

- Busiest days: Mondays (1,377 patients), Saturdays (1,322), Tuesdays (1,318).
- Peak hours: 11 AM, 1 PM, 7 PM, 11 PM → staffing adjustments needed.

👥 Patient Demographics

- Largest group: Adults (30–39 yrs, 1,200 patients).

- Next: Young Adults (20–29 yrs, 1,188), followed by middle-aged (40–50 yrs).

🌍 Race Distribution

- White (2,571), African American (1,951), Multiracial (1,557), Asian (1,060).

- 1,030 patients declined to identify race.

🚑 Admission Patterns

4,612 admitted, 4,604 treated & released → workload split is almost 50/50.

**Recommendations**

Based on insights, the hospital can improve operations by:
 - Reducing wait times through triage automation & digital check-ins.
 - Staffing optimization → increase staff on Mondays, Saturdays, and peak hours.
 - Expanding resources for General Practice & Orthopedics to handle high referrals.
 - Patient experience improvements → better communication & queue management.
